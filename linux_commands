Create a file :
use cat command and touch command 
touch : create an empty file using touch comand 
Cat   :create file and endter the curse into the file 

translate a file :
create a file  file.txt with Hello world
then translate this file like HELLO WORLD
CAT FILE.TXT | tr a-z A-Z >upper.txt
then check upper.txt
cat upper.txt
see like 
HELLO WORLD 

find location /path of any software 
1. which git 
2. command  -v git 

Remove the file :
rm filename 

Create Directory :
mkdir d
delete directory :
direction will be empty , use below command
rmdir directory_name
if  directory is not empty m use below command
rm -r directory name 
(a) rmdir &lt;dir name&gt;
(b) rm –r &lt;dir name&gt; (or) rm –R
To remove directories forcefully: rm –rf &lt;Directory name&gt;
Options r, R removes the contents of directory recursively.

Long list :
ls -R display all file including files of sub-directories 
ls -l display all files and directories with detials 
ls -a - display the .file as well 
ls -al
ls -lt , file.dir will display based on the time 
Display only directories :
ls ld */
To know the path of the directory where you are:
pwd
Pwd means ‘path working directory’.

cdChange directory
Going to default directory: just type ‘cd’ wherever you are.


Copy file :
cp source destion 

◦ Difference between $ and #
$ normal user
# super user

How to switch from one user to another user ( su )
◦ Importance of “sudo” “super user do”
◦ To get the current date ( date )
◦ To get the current month ( cal )

 Understanding file permissions :
file start - 
directory start with d

Changing the file permissions ( chmod )
First field: users permissions(rwx)
Second field: groups permissions(r-x)
Third field: Others permissions(r-x)
Fourth field: Number of hardlinks
5 th field: Owner of the file
6 th : group of the file
7 th : Timestamp when the file is created
8 th : Name of the fileTotal 24: gives the total number of blocks occupied by all files
To know whether a file is directory or not, file starts with ‘-‘ and directory starts with ‘d’.
Chmod command:
There are 3 permissions given to file: read, write, execute
Read(r)-4
Write(w)-2
Execute(x)-1
Chmod command changes the permissions of file.
users-u
groups-g
others-o





Display first 5 lines or 10 in file use the HEAD command : head -5 filename
Display last n number of lines or 10 in file use the tail command : tail -2 filename 


Pipe commands :
we want to get 5th line only fromt he file then use the pipe command 
head -5 file30 | tail -1 (| pipecommand )
get the result using first command (head -5 file30 ) then second command execute on the result of first command 


date - print current date
wc - word count 
number line / number of words /number of charcetes
 wc -l =only line 
wc -c =only characets 
wc -w  =only words 



i want to complete directory strucure by usinf tree command

================================
Connecting to servers passwordless:

There is a facility in unix to connect to the servers passwordless. When doing ssh, scp, sftp commands a
password will be asked to run the commands on destination server, in order to avoid this step below are
the following steps:
1) On the source server, run command ‘ssh-keygen –t rsa’ at the command prompt to save the
public key and private key. While running this command, a password will be asked but don’t give
password there just type enter. Then it will create public key and private key in hidden directory
‘.ssh’.


Go to the path where the keys are generated. In the above ex, the keys are created in the path
‘/root/.ssh


then cat authorized_keys

id_rsa.pub  public key
id_rsa  private key
3) Copy the created public key on the source server to destination server to file
‘/.ssh/authorized_keys’.
4) After copying command ssh, scp, sftp can be executed with passwordless from source server to
destination server.




=====================================

how to create the user in linux

To create new user
$ sudo useradd sai
$ vim /etc/passwd ( User will be created in this
file )
To set the password
$ sudo passwd sai ( sai is the username)
All users information is present in passwd file.
$ cd /etc
ls
$ vim /etc/passwd

============================

date - show the current date and time 
cal - show this month's calender
uptime - show the current time 
whoami -who you are logged in as
finger - display inforation about user 
Users /id -shows user infromation
man command  - shows manaul of command 
username  - show your username 
who /w - display who is online 









Network commands :

hostname  - gives the name of the server
hostname information is under cat /etc/hostname

# hostname linux-server - give the server name instalntly  ( temparary)

to restart the your systems 
# init 6

# ping <ip> -availability of destination server over the netwrok 

# wget download package /software onto linux systems 

#ifconfig / ip addr : lists IP address of the server 

#telnet connect to remote host /check port availability status- telnet usefull to tell you wheather particuler port is used or not
#telnet localhost 80 

in your PC , which port is running - use the below command

#netstat -tulpn

# curl : access the application as from browser ( in EC2 linux machine , you can access the goolge web page like # curl google.com )
what is use of curl command : once you have deployed your application , you just want to check from your local system wheather it is accessble or not 


==============================
Services command 

Service - this control the starting and stoping of services 
chkconfig -this controls which service are set to start on boot 

# service <name of the seerivce > status -to check status of the service
# service <name of the seerivce > start  - to start the service 
# service <name of the seerivce > stop - to stop the service 
# service <name of the seerivce > reload -to relaod the service 
# service <name of the seerivce > restart - to restart the service 

#chkconfig --list  ---to check the availability of seervice 
#chkconfig <Service> on -to make the service avaialble after restart
#chkconfig < Service> off - to make the service unavailable after restart

#chkconfig httpd on  - add it automatically and re boot and re start the linux machin then automatically active the service 

systemctl and service both are same 

#systemctl status servicename httpd

SSH - secure shall is method for secure remote login from one computer to another 
port: 22
Daemon : sshd
config file : /etc/ssh/sshd_config

httpd path : /vat/www/html


==================================

Process management command 

1.when you start a program or running an application in linux , it actually run as a process
2.a Linux process ( a deamon) , running in foreground or in the background , uses memory and cpu resources 

command          description
ps -ef        list the process which are running in the system 
kill /kill -9 kill aprocess or service
fg            run the program in the foreground
bg            run the serivce on the back ground 
top           list top 20 process which are consuming more cpu

bg explaination

# sleep 10 &
this is exectued background 

sometime what happen execute some command and take long time and push them background 

#sleep 500
then Ctrl +z - whenevery you give the ctrl+z this particuler process stopped and added to the process table 

use the jobs command 
# jobs 
[1] - stopped sleep 500

 then iwant to run the jobs background 

# bg %1 (1 job number)

then i want to bring the background jobs into frontend 
# fg %2

===============================================
Software managment command 

yum is the primary tool for getting ,installing ,deleting ,quering and managing redhat enterprise Linux RPM software packages from official redhat software repos 
as well as the third pary repos 

commands :

# yum install <Package name>
# yum remove <Package name>
# yum update <Package name>
# yum info <Package name>
#yum list avaialble
yum list installed 

#yum install wget -y ( -y means yes to install this software and don't ask me again )

check particuler package is installed or not 

# yum list installed | grep wget 

to check the software avaialbe or not in redhat repos 

#yum list available | grep wget


============================
system managment command 

command            Description
history          list all command by user 
free            free memory of a server   / #free -m

uname -a          show kernel information
du           show directory space usage 
whreis         show poaaible location of app
which           show which app will be run by default 

to know which version of operating systems in your server 

#cat /etc/redhat-release

# df  - show the file systems
#df -m  shoing 

sort occuped top 10 files in directory 

# du -k /var |sort -rn head


=====================================
User management commands 

 in linux 3 types of users 
    1. super or root user   : user is the most powerfull user , he is the administrater user 
    2. system user : user created by the software or application
    3. Normal user : Normal user are the users created by root user


type        exmaples         Home Directory         Shell
super user   Root              /root                /bin/bash
System User  ftp,ssh,apache     /var/ftp,etc        /sbin/nologin
Normal User   visitor,ec2-user  /home/username      /bin/bash




User creation :
whenever a user is created  in linux , below things happen by default 

 A home directory is created (/home/username)
 Unique UID and GID are given to user 
 An entry in /etc/passwd

syntax for creating a user in Linux 

# useradd <option><username>

Options are :
 -u user id
 -G Secondary group id 
 -g primary group id 
 -d home directory 
 -c comment 
 -s shell 


create a user :
# useradd john
#cd /home
# id john
will give one uid and gid ( uis = user id , gid = group id , groups=100) 
will check it 
# cat /etc/passwd ( you cann see all users here)

gorup of part of 
# cat /etc/group

#usermod to change the existing  attributes of user 

#usermod -G John(groupname) mark ( userid)

during docker setup we should add user to a docker group


Login as a User onto Ec2 instance
create a passowrd for john user 
# passwd john
newpassword : john
#cat /etc/passwd 

by default , AWS allow key-base authentication , so you have password only , that's why we have to change the password based configratio and edit it 

# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
open file change it passwordAuthentication yes
save it 

service sshd reload
	 
  LS Commands :

ls  - show all files and directory under the current directory 

FIle Permissions 

Permissions are applied at 3 level
 owner or user group
 group level
 Others level
Permissions are applied at 3 level
r -read only
w -write/edit/append/delete
x -Execute /run

unix/linux files have 8 attribute that can be seen with ls -lcommand 
# ls -l 
-rw-r--r--   1       root    root     8     may 7 20:29   file1
            file link                 size

-              rwx                 rw-                                   r--
file type     owner permisions  Primary group permisions           other permisions


files type
- normal file
b -block file 
c - character file 
d - directory
l -link files 


Change permisions on file or directory 

permisions can be set on any file /directory using two methods
1. symbolic method (ugo)
#chmod u=rwx g=rw ,o=r <filename > ( #chmod u+x file1)
#chmod u+x ,g-w,0=r file1 ( + means add permisions , - means remove  permision, = means overide the permision)
#chmod ugo=rwx <filename>
2. absolute method( numbers)
we use numbers insted of symbals 
read -4
write -2
execute -1
# chmod 764 <file name>
#chmod 777 <file name>
#chmod 666 file1
#chmod 755 file1
#chmod 000 file 1 ( no permision to every one)


Managing files or directories :

cp - copy a file
mv - move a file 
find - find a file  ( find / -name anyname)
grep -search for a pattern in a file
cd - switch b/w directroies
diff - find content difference in 2 files
sed -search adn replace particuler pattern 
chmod -change file permision
chown - change ownership of a file   ( chown user:group <file name> ; #chown john:john file2)( only root user can able to do the ownership of file )
#chown john file3 - only change the owner of the file not group 
file - show what kind of file it is

========================================================
Manage files and directory :

Cp - copy a file 
#cp touch file1 file 2
#cat>file
adding content
Ctl+c
file 2 does not have content

copy the content from file 1 to file 2

#cp file1 file2
#mkdir dir1
i want copy file into dir1 
# cp file1 dir1 ( destination location is directory then just check that directory file1 is there or not , not exist will create file1)
with in the directory , will create the file1

and also you can copy the directories
# cp dir1 dir2
 bith are directories , you have flags  -R
# cp -R dir1 dir2 


---------------------------------
move or rename a file 

mv  - move a file - something like cut and paste

#mv source file destination file
#mv file2 dir2
move the file2 from root to dir2 , does not exist file2 in root 
MV command use for rename file as well

#cd dir2
#mv file1 file3 ( move the content of file1 to file3 and disappear the file 1)

---------------------------------
Change directory -command : Cd

cd - siwtch b/w directories 

#pwd
/root
#cd ..
#pwd
/
#ls
you can see the entire hirachy of linux systems
#tree
#temp -you can keep tempary file

#cd temp
#pwd
/temp

# cd /root/dir1  this is called absulte path , start with /
#cd ../root/dir1   this is called relavent path , strt with ..
--------------------------------------------

how to search file - command : find , diff and file 
find command used to find the files or directories path , it is eaclty like this find option in windows where you can search for a file

syntax : find / -option filename 

-option : 
 -name : for searching a file with it's name 
-user for file whose owner is particuler user's
-group  for files belonging to particuler group

#find / -name file1


diff command - it is showing the difference b/w tow files
# diff file2 file3 

file command used for what type of file 

#file file1
file1: ASCII text
------------------------------
Search a word in a file  - command : grep 
Grep stands for Global Regular Expression print 
synatx: grep <pattern> filename 

#grep hello file1
#grep -i PERMIT /etc/ssh/sshd_config  ( i ignore the case sensitive)

#ls -l|grep envirment

form /etc dir , you need to fileter the directories only

#ls -l| grep ^d  ( ^ this carrot symbol , thi ^ helps us to seach first charactor is d or not) d should be starting latter of the lines


# grep ^t file1
--------------------------------------
Replace a Word in a file -Command : sed

sed stands for stream editor , which is used to search a word in the file and replace it with the word required to be in the output
note : it will only modfiy the output ,but there will be nochange in the original file

Examples :
sed 's/old_text/new_text' file_name    ( s- search)
sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' file_name  ( g -global)
sed -i 's/old_text/new_text' file_name
sed -n '5,10p' file_name   - disply 5 to 10 lines in the file 
sed '10,20p' file_name  - reome the 10 to 20 lines in the file and remain it will be display
