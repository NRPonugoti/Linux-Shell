The sed command is mainly used for text substitution. It allows you to replace all instances of a string with another string.
sed (Stream Editor) is a text processor used for transforming and filtering text. It’s particularly good for search and replace operations.
view file  content 
searching 
find and replace 
insertion and deletion 
sed also supports regular expression which allows it perfom complex pattern matching 

Advantage :
Sed can perform any operations on file without opening the file 
sed syntax:
sed [option] commands  [file-to-work-with-sed]

display file 
#sed '' filename 
sed 'p' filename  -it will print output twice 
sed -n 'p' filename - this will ignore 2 times print 
sed -n '$p'filename  -this will print last line 
sed -n '5 ,10p' filename  -it will print 5th to 10th line 
sed '10d' filename -only while displaying delete 10th line number )
sed -i'2,10d' filename  -delete in original file also 
sed -i.backup '2,10d' filename  -this will take backup before delete 

Example: To replace the word “sample” with “test” in sample.txt, use:

sed 's/sample/test/g' sample.txt

Example 1: Replace First Occurrence of a Pattern
sed 's/Linux/UNIX/' file.txt

Example 2: Replace All Occurrences of a Pattern
To replace all occurrences, not just the first, append g (global) to the command:

sed 's/Linux/UNIX/g' file.txt

============================================================================================================
find and replace with SED 

sed 's/root/devopsclass' filename (substitiute root with devops 1st word occurence with new world )
sed 's/root/devopsclass/g'filename (substitiute root with devops globally in whole file )
sed -i.backup 's/root/devopsclass/g' filename (changed original file itslef)
sed '/search/s/old/new/g' filename (Replace the old word with new word if that new line consists of search word)

====================================================================
insertion and deletion 
i and a (insert before and insert after )
#sed -i '1i ---------------' filename 
#sed -i '10a ###################' filename
